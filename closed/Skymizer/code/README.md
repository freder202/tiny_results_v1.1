# MLPerfâ„¢ Tiny Benchmarking with ONNC

Tiny ONNC is a user-friendly AI toolchain designed for deploying neural network models onto microcontrollers. It accomplishes this by generating a sequence of function calls that leverage neural network libraries. This submission specifically focuses on Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers, utilizing the CMSIS-NN library as the neural network library of choice. The CMSIS-NN library offers integer version of computation for widely used neural network operators. To ensure an optimal model accuracy, Tiny ONNC has developed a post-training quantization (PTQ) engine that aligns with the quantization scheme employed by the library.

The compiled result has been successfully ported to both Mbed OS and Zephyr OS, which are popular operating systems within the embedded system domain. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to reproduce the results presented in this submission. Please note that the instructions provided have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop.

# Mbed OS on NUCLEO_L4R5ZI
## Environment setup
1. Install python package
```bash
WS=`pwd`
bash envsetup-mbed_os.sh
python3 -m venv venv_mbed
source venv_mbed/bin/activate
pip3 install wheel==0.38.4
pip3 install -r requirements-mbed_os.txt
```
2. Download the [ARM compiler](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) according to your operating system and extract the tar file. The specific version is `gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2020-q2-update`

3. Set GCC_ARM_PATH
```bash
mbed config -G GCC_ARM_PATH `pwd`/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2020-q2-update/bin
```

## Build image
```bash
BENCHMARK=${WS}/NUCLEO_L4R5ZI-mbed_os/<MODEL>
cd ${BENCHMARK}
bash build.sh
```
Where MODEL is one of {ad, ic, kws, vww}.

The ONNC's generated code can be found in the `ad01_code`, `ic01_code`, `kws01_code`, and `vww01_code` folders.

## Deploy image to board
Connect your board (NUCLEO_L4R5ZI) to your computer using a micro-USB to USB cable, and enter the command:
```bash
cp ${BENCHMARK}/BUILD/<MODEL>.bin <your-board-path>
```
your-board-path may appear at `/media/$USER`

Now your board is ready for benchmarking.

# Zephyr OS on NUCLEO_L4R5ZI
## Environment setup
1. Install python package
```bash
WS=`pwd`
bash envsetup-zephyr.sh
python3 -m venv venv_zephyr
source venv_zephyr/bin/activate
pip3 install wheel==0.38.4
pip3 install -r requirements-zephyr.txt
```
2. [Install Zephyr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.7.0/getting_started/index.html)
```bash
# init Zephyr project with correct version
west init --mr v2.7-branch "${WS}/zephyrproject" # this could take a while since it downloads a large repository

# setup Zephyr environment
cd ${WS}/zephyrproject/zephyr
# Fixed version to v2.7.4-9-gc520749a7128
git checkout c520749a71289a61b25a3e779c857669f80854c2
cd ${WS}/zephyrproject
west update # this could take a while since it will update the submodules to the correct version based on v2.7-branch
west zephyr-export
pip3 install -r ${WS}/zephyrproject/zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt

# install Zephyr SDK
wget https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v0.13.2/zephyr-sdk-0.13.2-linux-x86_64-setup.run
chmod a+x zephyr-sdk-0.13.2-linux-x86_64-setup.run
./zephyr-sdk-0.13.2-linux-x86_64-setup.run -- -d ${WS}/zephyr-sdk

# export required environment variables
export ZEPHYR_BASE="${WS}/zephyrproject/zephyr"
export PATH="${PATH}:${WS}/zephyr-sdk/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin"
export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=zephyr
export ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR="${WS}/zephyr-sdk"
```
3. Download CMSIS

```bash
cd ${WS}
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5.git
cd CMSIS_5
git checkout b966796
cp ${WS}/arm_convolve_HWC_q7_fast_nonsquare.fixed CMSIS/NN/Source/ConvolutionFunctions/arm_convolve_HWC_q7_fast_nonsquare.c
export CMSIS_PATH=`pwd`
```

## Build image
```bash
BENCHMARK=${WS}/NUCLEO_L4R5ZI-zephyr/<MODEL>
cd ${BENCHMARK}
bash build.sh
```

Where MODEL is one of {ad, ic, kws, vww}.

The ONNC's generated code can be found in the `ad01_code`, `ic01_code`, `kws01_code`, and `vww01_code` folders.

## Deploy image to board
Connect your board (NUCLEO_L4R5ZI) to your computer using a micro-USB to USB cable, and enter the command:
```bash
cp ${BENCHMARK}/build/zephyr/zephyr.bin <your-board-path>
```
your-board-path may appear at `/media/$USER`

Now your board is ready for benchmarking.

# Benchmark by using energy runner
You can [download energy runner](https://www.eembc.org/energyrunner/mlperftiny/) mentioned from [its repo](https://github.com/eembc/energyrunner), and extract it

```bash
mkdir ${WS}/EnergyRunner_MLPerfTiny
mv EnergyRunner_MLPerfTiny_Linux.tar.gz ${WS}/EnergyRunner_MLPerfTiny
cd ${WS}/EnergyRunner_MLPerfTiny
tar zxvf EnergyRunner_MLPerfTiny_Linux.tar.gz
```

The EnergyRunner reads the dataset from `$USER/eembc/runner/benchmarks/ulp-mlperf/datasets/`, so you will need to copy the test dataset to this location.

You can find the test data in the datasets directory of the [EnergyRunner repository](https://github.com/eembc/energyrunner/tree/main/datasets). Alternatively, you can generate the test data using the [provided source scripts](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny/tree/master/benchmark/training).

```
sudo mkdir -p /root/eembc/runner/benchmarks/ulp-mlperf/datasets/
# Copy test data to /root/eembc/runner/benchmarks/ulp-mlperf/datasets/
```

- NOTE: Since the kws test data is scaled and shifted using ONNC's scale/shift, the test data generated by using the [provided source scripts](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny/tree/master/benchmark/training/keyword_spotting) should apply the same scale/shift from the `onnc_get_io_scaling_factors` function in `kws01_code/onnc_main.cpp`.


Then start the energy runner
```
sudo ${WS}/EnergyRunner_MLPerfTiny/benchmark-framework --no-sandbox
```

## 3. Energy mode
To enable energy mode, please modify the build command and rebuild the image accordingly.
 - Add `-D EE_CFG_ENERGY_MODE=1` at `mbed compile` in `build.sh` of Mbed
 - Use `cmake -DENERGY_MODE=1 ..` in `build.sh` of Zephyr

Please refer to the [Setup Energy Mode Hardware]((https://github.com/eembc/energyrunner#energy-mode-hardware)) guide or [tutorial videos](https://github.com/eembc/energyrunner#tutorial-videos--slides) to properly set up your board and begin the benchmarking process.
 - The voltage is set to 1800 mV.
 - On Zephyr, the timestamp pin is connected to connector CN7 pin 1.
