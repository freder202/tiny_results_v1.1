# The Explanation of Energy

We did not participate in the energy measurement. But we compute the energy consumption using a simple way. 
FPGA_Engineering_Fig1 and FPGA_Engineering_Fig2 shows the power consumption, we can see the total on-chip power is 
4.748W, then we can compute the energy using the following formula (2683 means 2683fps):

energy = (1/2683) * 4.748 * 1000000 = 1770uj
