 The given graph represents energy values in relation to the squared voltage at specific voltage levels. The squared voltages considered are (2.5&#178;) volts, (3.0&#178;) volts, and (3.3&#178;) volts. Based on this data, after applying a logarithmic transformation and performing linear regression analysis, the predicted energy for the Image Classification model at a voltage of (1.8&#178;) volts is 10,321.44 uJ/inf.
